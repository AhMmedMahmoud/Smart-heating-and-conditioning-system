# Smart-heating-and-conditioning-system-using-Atmega16
This project was written in C using Microchip Studio and Proteus 8 professional.
## Aim
simulate the embedded controller in a smart heating and conditioning system
## Procedure Details
microcontroller keeps reading temperature using temperature sensor then processes the read.
- If the air temperature is 20째 or less, the heater and its red led are turned on and "Heater Mood" is displayed  on the LCD.
- If the air temperature is 30째 or more, the cooler and its blue led are turned on and "Cooler mood" is displayed  on the LCD.
- If the air temperature is from 20째 to 30째, green led is turned on and "default mood" is displayed  on the LCD
                                                 and so on..
